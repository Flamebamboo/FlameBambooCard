## Total Spent: 5 hours 20 minutes

# June 30th: Started the schematic

I am following this tutorial from https://jams.hackclub.com/jam/hacker-card, The tutorial uses EasyEDA on the web which is new for me so I spent a little bit of extra time navigating through the platform.
After watching the tutorial and going through the figma slides, referring to the datasheets provided I got the schematic done

# June 31th: Transforming to PCB

I positioned the components to be aligned nicely, then I routed the components together making sure there's no short circuit or have any traces overlaps as mentioned in the tutorial.
Next I added my information for the content of the card aswell as adding personalised silkscreen like the duck! At the back I added a QRcode to my personal portfolio
